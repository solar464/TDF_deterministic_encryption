This project requires Python3.7

Install dependencies and setup the project using pipenv or pip:
  make build

Encoding and Decoding example:

  from ddh_tdf import KG

  x: bytes = b'\x00\x01\x02'
  #Initialize index and trapdoor keys with maximum encodable message length
  ik, tk = KG(length = len(x) * 8)

  #alternatively, deserialize existing keys from files
  #ik = deserialize(filename)
  #tk = deserialize(filename)
  
  u: DDH_TDF_CipherText = ik.encode(x)
  result: bytes = tk.decode(u)

Time the performance of important functions, optional LEN argument to change size of structures:
  make benchmark LEN=(size of msg in bytes)

Run the unit tests using the unittest package:
  make test

Remove build, test, benchmark files:
  make clean

Other options are listed:
  make help

The TDF construction depends on arithmetic over ed25519 points implemented by floodberry at
  https://github.com/floodyberry/ed25519-donna
A cython interface was written for floodberry's package so it could be used in this python TDF construction and is built during (make build).
